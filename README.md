Debian partman-reiser4 component integrates Reiser4 support into menu-driven Debian-Installer (d-i).
It requires reiser4-debian-parted: https://github.com/Metztli/debian-parted-reiser4 ; otherwise, Reiser4 will fail to install.

Added support for 'discard' mount option, closing https://github.com/edward6/reiser4/issues/18
